# Fylewebassignment
In January 2019, [Fyle company](https://www.fylehq.com/ "https://www.fylehq.com") sent me an [image](./img/photos/assignment.jpg "./img/photos/assignment.jpg") on [Internshala](https://internshala.com/ "https://internshala.com") and told me to create a static website exactly with the same layout as show in the image in order to prove my knowledge and skills. I created [that website](https://zulfequar.github.io/fylewebassignment/ "https://zulfequar.github.io/fylewebassignment") and kept the source code in this repository. The website is very responsive across different sizes of screens.
