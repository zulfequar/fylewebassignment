# fylewebassignment
In March 2019, Fyle company (www.fylehq.com) sent me an image on Internshala app and told me to create a static website exactly as show in the image in order to prove my knowledge and skills. I created that website (https://zulfequar.github.io/fylewebassignment/) and kept the source code in this repository. To see that image, visit the website and click on the "Assignment Image" link below the social media icons at the bottom of the home page.
